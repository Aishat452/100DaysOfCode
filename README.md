# 100 Days of Code Challenge
Welcome to my 100 days of code challenge!

## About the Challenge
The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal of this challenge is to improve coding skills, develop a coding habit, and work towards achieving specific coding goals.

### My Goals
My main goal for this challenge is to [insert your specific goal here, such as "build a web application using React and Node.js" or "improve my problem-solving skills in Python"]. In addition to this, I also plan to:

Code for at least an hour every day, preferably at the same time every day.
Keep a daily log of my progress and share it on my social media to hold myself accountable.
Complete at least one project every week to apply the concepts I learn.
Join a coding community or find an accountability partner to share my progress and learn from others.
Progress
I will be updating this README with my progress every day. You can also follow my progress on [insert your social media platform and handle] using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

Day 1/100:
<!-- [Insert progress made on day 1, such as "set up my development environment and completed the first few exercises of my chosen course."] -->

Day 2/100:
<!-- [Insert progress made on day 2, such as "worked on creating a basic layout for my web application using React."] -->

### Conclusion
I am excited to take on this challenge and commit to improving my coding skills. I hope this README message serves as a source of motivation for others who are also taking on the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Let's do this!
