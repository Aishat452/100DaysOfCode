# 100 Days of Code Challenge
Welcome to my 100 days of code challenge!

## About the Challenge
The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal of this challenge is to improve coding skills, develop a coding habit, and work towards achieving specific coding goals.

### My Goals
My main goal for this challenge is to build a web application using React and Node.js and improve my problem-solving skills in Python Javascript and PHP. In addition to this, I also plan to improve my ability to be patient while learning, in other to achieve greater goals.

WITH ALL THIS IN MIND, I PLEDGE TO MYSELF TO:

Code for at least an hour OR two every day, preferably at the same time every day.
Keep a daily log of my progress and share it on my social media to hold myself accountable.
Complete at least one project every week to apply the concepts I learn.
Join a coding community or find an accountability partner to share my progress and learn from others.
