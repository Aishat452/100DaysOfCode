# 100 Days of Code Challenge
Welcome to my 100 days of code challenge!

## About the Challenge
The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. The goal of this challenge is to improve coding skills, develop a coding habit, and work towards achieving specific coding goals.

### My Goals
My main goal for this challenge is to build a web application using React and Node.js and improve my problem-solving skills in Python Javascript and PHP. In addition to this, I also plan to improve my ability to be patient while learning, in other to achieve greater goals.

WITH ALL THIS IN MIND, I PLEDGE TO MYSELF TO:

Code for at least an hour OR two every day, preferably at the same time every day.
Keep a daily log of my progress and share it on my social media to hold myself accountable.
Complete at least one project every week to apply the concepts I learn.
Join a coding community or find an accountability partner to share my progress and learn from others.

## Progress
I will be updating this README with my progress every day. You can also follow my progress on twitter using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.

Day 1/100:
I set up my development environment and completed the first few exercises of my chosen course.

Day 2/100:
I worked on understanding different HTML elements and attributes for example: sections, divs, head, articles, asides, h1-h6 and more. Attributes like: hrefs, alt, for, value, id, class and more.

I proceeded to learn inline CSS: by adding colors to my little design.

Day 3/100:
I  learnt how to use colors in CSS: how to use the HEX CODE and RGB to access different colors. How to link the external CSS and other files, how to use some CSS properties.
I also learn how to use the anchor tags with its attribute (href) and more

### Conclusion
I am excited to take on this challenge and commit to improving my coding skills. I hope this README message serves as a source of motivation for others who are also taking on the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Let's do this!
